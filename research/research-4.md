A large proportion of autistic people belong to at least one other minority group in addition to being autistic. Intersectionality is commonly used to refer to membership of more than one minority group (i.e., people who sit at the intersection of different minority communities).

People with intersecting oppressed identities experience not only the same oppression as people in one or the other of those groups, but also unique facets of prejudice and disadvantage that apply to that combination of identities. It's therefore crucial to understand all aspects of identity.

Look out for info about projects in this area soon.
