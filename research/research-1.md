While all children should have access to language learning - and the related opportunities that come with this - as a fundamental human right, this is currently not the case for all autistic children.

We know that parents & professionals are often concerned that a bilingual environment could be harmful for autistic children - despite this idea not being built on evidence.

My research aims to provide an evidence base for families, and focuses on:

1. Understanding the lived experiences of autstic bilingual people
2. Creating inclusive tools to better understand the effects of bilingualism on developmental processes - regardless of language levels.
