Currently in the UK, there are 42,500 autistic children in mainstream education (DfE 2015), with the number of children rising comparably internationally. Yet, we currently know very little from autistic children themselves regarding how they can best be supported to thrive socially in school.

There can be a significant disconnect between the school experience for autistic children and stated aspirations of inclusive school practices. There are long-established concerns regarding the school experience for autistic children, with research commonly reporting feelings of unhappiness and dissatisfaction, experiences of bullying and victimisation  and increased social exclusion.

My research focuses on understanding children's school experiences, and working with staff to find accessible ways to record and implement children's views in school. I am also conducting research with [Caryll Jack ](https://mobile.twitter.com/CaryllJack)and [Laura Crane ](https://mobile.twitter.com/LauraMayCrane)to understand the experiences of neurodivergent trainee teachers at QMU, and the barriers to inclusion.
