I am interested in cognitive processes and changes accross development. In my research to date, I have focused on a number of key areas:

I have conducting a longitudinal study to understand the impact of bilingualism on cognitive development for autistic and non-autistic children. I have also focused on differential lateralisation in infants who go on to recieve an autism diagnosis and in preterm infants. I have also worked on projects looking to better understand the relationship between side biases as a marker of lateralisation, and the links to cognitive skills. 

Within this field, it's also a priority for me to develop inclusive tools to better understand the cognitive processes, ensuring that we can include children who are frequently excluded from research - this includes children with intellectual disabilities, minimally verbal or non-speaking children.
