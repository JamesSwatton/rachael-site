**Really proud of this paper by me,** [**Bérèngere Digard**](https://twitter.com/BerengereDigard) **&** [**Sue Fletcher-Watson**](https://twitter.com/SueReviews)**,** where we discuss autism & equal opportunities for language learning:

**Paper in a nutshell:** We argue that children should have access to language learning (and the experiences that come with this) as a fundamental human right - currently, however, this is not the case for all autistic children. Research finds no long-term negative effects of bilingualism for autistic people, & crucially a plethora of real-world benefits, ie: stronger family bonds **/** friendship opportunities **/** access to hobbies & education **/** higher self confidence **/** links with wellbeing & self-understanding.

Yet, many practitioners & parents are worried about bilingualism, and bilingual parents are still frequently advised to raise their autistic child with just one language. It's clear that research isn't informing advice & practice. We consider some of the main barriers to equal language opportunities for autistic bilingual children, focusing on familial, clinical & educational contexts. We present potential solutions to promote access to language learning for all autistic children & young people. 

We're keen to take this conversation further, so please [let us know ](mailto:rdavis@qmu.ac.uk)what you think!
