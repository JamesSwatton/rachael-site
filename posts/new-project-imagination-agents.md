Really pleased to be working on a new project - **Imagination Agents** - run by Dr Helen Burns and funded by the Royal Society Edinburgh:

_Imagination Agents aim to support young peoplesâ€™ imaginations and through this, their sense of agency within their present and future environments. The project focuses artistically on a need to address environmental degradation in Glasgow, and in the process facilitate the development of sustainable, cognitive capacities - imagination, metacognition (learning to learn) and agency - in participants._
