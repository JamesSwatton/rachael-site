In my research, I prioritise lived experiences, putting the childs voice at the forefront of research, and making sure that key findings reach autistic people, families, educators and clinicans. 

If you are interested in working with me as a collaborator or have a student project you'd like to discuss, send me an [**email!**](mailto:rdavis@qmu.ac.uk)
