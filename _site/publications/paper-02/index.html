<h2>Abstract</h2>

<p>Deficit-based accounts of social and communication abilities continue to
dominate autism research. However, emerging findings suggest that this view may
be overly simplistic and discount the two-way nature of interaction. Here we
discuss the reconceptualization of social cognition to consider such
difficulties as examples of bidirectional, multifaceted misattunement between
autistic and nonautistic individuals. Aligned with progressive theoretical
frameworks, emerging empirical research indicates that mismatches in
communication styles can contribute to autistic social difficulties and the
important role that nonautistic difficulties play. We highlight two areas of
future research with the aim of providing empirical support for the views that
the autistic community has proposed over the past 2 decades. We discuss the
impact of such a paradigm shift on a number of levels, including how bridging
the gap between different interaction styles can reduce stigma and increase
understanding. Adopting such a framework will provide radical opportunities for
transformative societal changes and education around inclusion.</p>
