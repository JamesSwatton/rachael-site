<h2>Abstract</h2>

<p>Bilingualism is a valuable tool that enriches and facilitates cultural, social
and lived experiences for autistic and non-autistic people alike. Research
consistently finds no negative effects of bilingualism and highlights the
potential for positive effects across cognitive and socio-cultural domains for
autistic and non-autistic children. Yet parents of autistic children remain
concerned that bilingualism will cause delays in both cognitive and language
development and are still frequently advised by practitioners to raise their
child monolingually. Evidently, findings from research are not reflected in
practice or subsequent advice, and it is essential to identify ways to ensure
equal access to additional language learning. We briefly summarise the existing
literature on bilingualism and autism, considering perspectives from the
bilingual autistic community, and experimental research. We identify the most
pertinent barriers to participation for autistic bilingual children in terms of
familial, clinical and educational perspectives. We propose novel solutions to
promote additional language learning, and suggest changes to practice that will
contribute to an evidence base for families and practitioners. This commentary
makes innovative recommendations at both the individual and societal level to
ensure that autistic bilingual people have equal rights and opportunities to
language learning and are optimally supported in accessing them.</p>
