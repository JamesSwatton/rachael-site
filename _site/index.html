    <p>I am a developmental psychologist whose research focuses on autism, cognition, and education (mostly!). Central to my work is a commitment to involving the communities that I study in the research process; ensuring this research has a strong participatory ethos and is of direct and has real-world relevance to the people that matter.</p>
<p>I’m just starting as a lecturer in Psychology &amp; Education at QMU in Edinburgh, and before this, I was a Research fellow at the SMRC at the University of Edinburgh. I am part of advisory board working with the Scottish Government on how to increase understanding of autism in the general public across Scotland <a href="https://differentminds.scot/">https://differentminds.scot/</a>.</p>
<p>I’m also trying to get better at Open Science, and you can find my preprints and pre-registered reports and links to data in my projects.</p>
