This article examines the ways in which bilingualism influences social and cognitive development and identifies intersections between corresponding aspects of autism, to inform future research directions. Three key domains are identified: social cognition; executive functions; and social-cultural factors. In each case we describe the evidence for the impact of bilingualism in typical development and map this onto what is known about the domain in autism. We examine the methodological quality of the existing literature to make recommendations for future approaches. Results suggest a dearth of high-quality research and lack of consensus. Research priorities include the need for innovative designs to explore potential impacts of bilingualism in order to increase the validity of the evidence base for caregivers and professionals.
