Autism is a highly heritable neurodevelopmental condition, with prevalence estimated at 1 in 100 people worldwide (Elsabbagh et al., 2012). Autism is diagnosed by behavioural presentation, and although there is substantial variability both within autistic people across the lifespan, and between autistic individuals, a set of core diagnostic criteria are relied on by clinicians. These criteria are broadly categorised in two ways: (1) distinctive patterns of social communication and interactions with others, and (2) restricted or repetitive behaviours or interests (American Psychiatric Association, APA, 2013) (for a comprehensive overview of the current autism research, see: Fletcher-Watson & Happ√©, 2019). Given the emphasis on social and communication difficulties in the diagnostic criteria of autism, and the pivotal role they play in development generally, these domains are commonly key targets for autism interventions. Here, we first provide an overview of different types of traditional social interventions and evaluate their effectiveness and validity. We also present some of the possible risks associated with such interventions, and suggest a number of means for autistic children to develop social and communication capacities on their own terms, in both family and educational settings. We end by considering some other factors essential for understanding the social development of autistic children in context and informing development and delivery of supports.
