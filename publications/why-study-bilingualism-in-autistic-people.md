Direct research into autism and bilingualism does not indicate that bilingualism poses disadvantages for autistic people in terms of language development. In addition, there are clear and powerful arguments for the importance of bilingualism in supporting the family unit and its cultural heritage. It is vital that clinicians are aware of existing findings suggesting no detrimental effects of bilingualism, in order to be able to give informed language environment recommendations to families. Regardless of any potential benefit, or indeed disadvantage, from being bilingual, autistic childrenâ€™s rights to their cultural and linguistic heritage are paramount.

This editorial provides an overview of the current state of reseach and highlights future areas of focus for research.
