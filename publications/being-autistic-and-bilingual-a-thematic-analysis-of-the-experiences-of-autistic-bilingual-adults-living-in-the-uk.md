While being multilingual (knowing 2 or more languages) is becoming a more common experience globally, little is known about the combined experience of multilingualism and autism. Research currently available focuses on quantifying language and cognitive development, and the only two qualitative accounts of first-hand experiences are from either bilingual children or highly multilingual adults (with 4 languages or more), which may not represent the wider autistic multilingual population, with all other accounts focusing on parents or practitioners. This qualitative study reports the experiences of autistic bi- and multilingual adults, focusing on barriers and enablers to language learning and reported benefits of bilingualism.  
Thirty-nine UK-based autistic bi- and multilingual adults (41% female, mean age = 33.2 years, range = 16-61) with knowledge of 2 to 7 languages (mean = 3.6, SD = 1.4) completed an online Demographic and Language Questionnaire including three open-ended questions about the interplay between autism and bilingualism. A thematic analysis was conducted on the responses to these open-ended questions. Participants perceived many opportunities and benefits brought by multilingualism, in terms of relationships, hobbies, mobility, employment, education, and cultural insight. Respondents reported social communication as being a major benefit of being multilingual, and discussed how multilingualism had broadened their mindset, while identifying factors that had enabled or challenged their language learning journey. This study builds upon the few reports available to highlight experiences that are shared by autistic bi- and multilingual people regardless of the number of languages they know. It is the first study to report the perspectives of autistic bi- and multilingual adults who, in most cases, did not have a special interest in languages and grew up in a bilingual environment. Importantly, accounts of the factors that can facilitate or hinder language learning will inform the development of strategies to better support autistic people. These findings have implications for bilingual families and practitioners supporting autistic bi- and multilingual people.
