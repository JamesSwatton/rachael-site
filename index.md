I am a developmental psychologist whose research focuses on autism, cognition, and education (mostly!). Central to my work is a commitment to involving the communities that I work with in the research process; ensuring this research has a strong participatory ethos and has real-world relevance to the people that matter.

I’m a lecturer in Psychology & Education at QMU in Edinburgh, and before this, I was a Research fellow at the SMRC, University of Edinburgh. I am part of an advisory board working with the Scottish Government on how to increase understanding of autism in the general public across Scotland [https://differentminds.scot/](https://differentminds.scot/).

I’m also trying to get better at Open Science, and you can find my preprints and pre-registered reports and links to data in my projects [here](https://osf.io/92fjy/).
