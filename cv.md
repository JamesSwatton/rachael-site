## EDUCATION

### 2013-2017
**PhD Psychology**, Centre for Brain and Cognitive Sciences, Birkbeck,
*University of London.
Thesis: “An Empirical and Computational Investigation of Variable outcomes in
Autism Spectrum Disorders”.  Supervised by Professor Michael Thomas and
Professor Tony Charman.

My doctoral research aimed to investigate the variability observed in the
profiles of autistic children, our ability to predict this variability based on
measures in early infancy, and the underlying mechanisms that generate this
variability. I combined the analysis of the of data from the world’s largest
prospective, longitudinal dataset of children with an increased familial
likelihood of autism, with data generated from computational models that I
designed and created. I analysed complex datasets with sophisticated
longitudinal modelling techniques. I received funding for this research from a
Bloomsbury Colleges Scholarship.

### 2010-2012
**MSc Cognitive Neuroscience** *(Distinction)* - University College London &
Birkbeck, University of London.

Dissertation: Tool Use and the Flexibility of the Body Schema in Typically
Developing Children. Supervised by Dr Andrew Bremner.

### 2006-2009
**BSc(Hons) Psychology**, Goldsmiths, University of London.

## EMPLOYMENT

### January 2018 - present
**Postdoctural Research Fellow**, Salvesen Mindroom Research Centre, University
of Edinburgh.

I am the project manager lead researcher on an innovative project investigating
the effects of bilingualism on cognitive and social development in children with
and without autism. I am responsible for all aspects of project design and
implementation. This included designing and implementing four novel eye tracking
paradigms for use with minimally verbal children, and designing parent interview
tools. I was responsible for writing project protocols, conducting analyse and
data management, ethical approval, and all public engagement and dissemination
activities, including writing publications and grants. I am the chair and
organiser of advisory board meetings and have been the line manager for a
research assistant since 2019.

### January 2017 - December 2017
**Postdoctoral Research Assistant**, Centre for Brain and Cognitive Sciences,
Birkbeck, University of London.

This aim of this research project was to assess motor abilities and identify
possible differences in cerebral lateralisation in children with and without
autism. I co-designed the methodologies including designing new qualitative and
quantitative communication surveys for teachers. I organised and conducted data
collection sessions for 120 children, and was responsible for data analysis, and
dissemination of findings through, conference presentations and co-authoring two
journal articles.

### Jan 2017 - May 2018

**Associate Lecturer Birkbeck**, University of London. Please see section 4 for
all teaching and supervision activities.

### September 2009 - August 2015
**Teaching Assistant** (full time: 2009-2011, 0.3 FTE: 2011-2015), primary and
secondary schools, London.

## RESEARCH
### Current research interests
I am a developmental psychologist and my research focuses on two main areas: (1)
Using longitudinal methods to understand early differences in cognitive
development, and the subsequent effects on later developmental outcomes. (2)
eliciting children’s voices to inform best practice in educational and family
settings. This strand of my research is Informed primarily by my experience as a
teaching assistant. In both areas I implement novel and engaging methodologies
to include children who are frequently excluded from research, including
minimally verbal children and children with intellectual disabilities.

Central to this work is a commitment to involving the communities that I study
in the research process; ensuring this research has a strong participatory ethos
and is of direct and practical relevancetothoseitaffects.
Iachievethisthroughacomprehensiveprogrammeofdissemination, dialogue and
partnership activities. I am also a strong advocate of public engagement and
community outreach; ensuring that research is accessible to the public, to
policy makers and practitioners, and – importantly – to stakeholders.
